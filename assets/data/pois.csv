30,Banco Azteca,,"ATM, Bank","Small max withdrawal limits from the single ATM.  (ATM works 24 hours.)  Currently 6k pesos.  (About $300 USD.). Recommended to go to HSBC in town.  There you can pull up to 15k in one pop, and do multiple withdrawals back-to-back-to-back.  The middle ATM at HSBC also dispenses USD.  There are also a lot of ATMs inside Chedraui, for instance Citibank and BaNorte (lowest two withdrawal fees at under $2 each.). Note:  Don’t be surprised if many ATMs are empty on Monday mornings or after long / holiday weekends.  Also, highly recommend travelers use the Charles Schwab Invest First Visa.  No ATM fees, and they reimburse you all ATM fees you incur abroad.  Amazing.  Not to mention if you deny the exchange conversion on an ATM, allowing Schwab to do the conversion, you’ll get the mid-market rate, which is what you see on XE.com.  If you hit the “accept exchange rate” on an ATM, you’re getting robbed around 5.5%.","Sunday		9AM–9PM

Go-to for all types of hair from all ethnicities.

You can pay about $20 USD here for a day pass to use their swimming pools.  The one in front is the famous one with the hammocks over the water.  Expect people to be taking a lot of pics here.  The one in the back is less Instagrammable, and the one I prefer.  You can often chill here for hours and see no one or only a few people.  Better yet, check them both out.  Also, the yoga schedule is posted on a board right when you walk into the main Holistika property.  Holistika’s yoga classes are literally world-famous.
